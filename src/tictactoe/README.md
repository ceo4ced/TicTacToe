<h2>Project for COMP 560: Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<h2>Task: Implement algorithims to solve a 4x4x4 Tic Tac Toe game using Java</h2>

<h3>How to run the program?</h3>

1) First, place the TicTacToe4x4x4.jar file in a directory.  <br/>
2) Second, inside the terminal application, find the TicTacToe4x4x4.jar file.  <br/>
3) Third, enter "java -jar TicTacToe4x4x4.jar".  <br/>
4) Once loaded, enter three run iteration numbers with a space between each number.  Each number represents the iteration number the application will print the gameboard probability table to the terminal screen. For example: 200 300 500 <br/>
5) Review the three probability tables printed at each declared point.
